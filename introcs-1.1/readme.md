Python modules to support the book _Introduction to Programming with Python_ by Robert Sedgewick, Kevin Wayne, and Robert Dondero.

### Note

The modules `picture.py`, `stdaudio.py`, and `stddraw.py` were updated on 2019 August 13.

Here are the [most recent modules](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/code/) available on the booksite. The modules in [introcs-1.0.zip](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/python/code/dist/introcs-1.0.zip) provided by the installation instructions remain out of date.

The `introcs-1.1` library in this repository
